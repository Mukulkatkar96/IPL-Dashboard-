    ### 🔍 Key Insights:
    - **High-priced players** like Rishabh Pant and Shreyas Iyer topped auction charts.
    - **No strong correlation** found between price and performance — some mid/low-priced players outperform.
    - **Performance clusters** show value-for-money opportunities for teams.
    - Rising player prices since 2018 reflect IPL’s commercialization, not always performance merit.

This project explores two questions:
1. **Do the most expensive IPL players consistently deliver top performance?**
2. **How did IPL evolve into a multi-billion-dollar global sports league?**

By combining auction prices, player performance, media rights, and social media engagement, we’ve created interactive dashboards that reveal the truth behind the numbers.

st.markdown("""
### 💰 Top 5 Most Expensive Batsmen
- **Rishabh Pant** and **Shreyas Iyer** lead the list with prices of ₹27 Cr each.
- **Yuvraj Singh**, **Nicholas Pooran**, and **Jos Buttler** also feature among the costliest.
- While some deliver consistently, others underperform relative to their price.

---

### 📉 Auction Price vs Runs (Scatter Plot)
- The scatter plot shows a **negative correlation** between price and runs for many players.
- This suggests **expensive players don’t always score more**.
- A cluster of **low-to-mid priced players consistently achieve decent runs**, offering better value-for-money.

---

### 📈 Price Change by Season
- A clear trend of **rising player prices** over the years, especially post-2018.
- Reflects the IPL's growing commercial strength and competitive bidding.

---

### 📊 Price Distribution by Player Category
- Players categorized as **Elite, High, Mid, Low**.
- **Elite and High** categories consume most of the total spend, but do not always correlate with highest outputs.

---

### 📋 Player Table (Top Value Players)
- Some players like **Sam Curran** and **Pat Cummins** have **modest prices but reasonable output**.
- Helps identify **undervalued players** – key for franchise strategy.

---

### 🧠 Insight Summary
> **“Expensive doesn’t always mean effective.”**
> The analysis uncovers a **misalignment** between auction hype and actual output.
> This opens up questions about ROI, scouting strategy, and value metrics in IPL auctions.
